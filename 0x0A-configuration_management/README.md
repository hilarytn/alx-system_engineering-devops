# 0x0A Configuration management

This directory contains files created in response to tasks set forth in Holberton student project "0x0A Configuration management". This directory contains three Puppet manifests which serve as a proverbial dip of the toe into the pond of the management tool.

#### Task 0: [0-create_a_file.pp]
* Using Puppet, create a file in `/tmp`
#### Task 1: [1-install_a_package.pp]
* Using Puppet, install `puppet-lint`
#### Task 2: [2-execute_a_command.pp]
* Using Puppet, create a manifest that kills a process named `killmenow`
